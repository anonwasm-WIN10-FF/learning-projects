~~ consolidate the two lists, find a reasonable format for the workflow. 

[] find checklist etc syntax
[] list out goals 
[] learn linux
[] learn python
[] mini-tasks/exercises/projects for each 
[] 'multiple personality disorder' git 'personalities' for practice (linux distro and windows vscode git tag commit branch tasks I designate 'individually'
(simulate working either end of a realistic workflow environment on different OS etc) 
[]first mini projects for each major goal 
[] edx course
[] cs50x
[] include books etc
[] learn nice linux way of 'add this task to my to-do list and commit' 
(probably a script, right?)
 []write first script (python or terminal?)

show everything! Why not . 
^^ commit 1 etc 


--> start by having one 'index' repository (this one) and having it maybe explain things, but will be like a link tree for other repositories, as things like
linux study and python initial study would not be very related, and keep an eye out for a better way.

^^ committ here  (trying to do too much, but will try to do it slowly and practice a lot, and overlap where I can.
